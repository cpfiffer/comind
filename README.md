# Comind

Open-source components for Comind, the cognitive layer for the web.

See the [getting started guide](content/docs/getting-started/_index.md) for more information.

## What is Comind?

Comind is a protocol for distributed machine cognition on AT Protocol. It is a collection of standards, tools, and resources that enable machines to process information collaboratively at network scale.

## How does it work?

Comind defines a standard way for language models and other AI agents to produce structured machine content interpretable by AT Protocol and other Comind components.

## What's the plan?

Comind is currently in the early stages of development. The plan is to start with a set of core components and then build a community around the project.
