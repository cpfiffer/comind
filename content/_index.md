Comind is a cognitive layer for [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) that processes social network activity to understand how ideas move and communities grow. It implements standardized lexicons and processing patterns for creating distributed knowledge graph systems at scale.

Comind is **extremely** early and unstable. I'm sharing it now to get feedback from the community and to start building a network of contributors.

See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cpfiffer/comind) for the latest code and documentation. Or, follow me at [@cameron.pfiffer.org](https://bsky.app/profile/cameron.pfiffer.org) for updates.

## Core Components

- **Blips**: Atomic units of information formatted as ATProto records, such as thoughts, concepts, and emotions
- **Links**: Typed relations between blips with semantic context
- **Cominds**: Specialized AI agents that process network activity
- **Spheres**: Workspaces defined by core directives that focus agent cognition
- **Melds**: Interaction protocol for accessing sphere knowledge

## Get Started

- Read the [devlogs](/blog) for implementation details and ongoing development
- See the [docs](/docs) for technical specifications
- Explore the [code](https://github.com/cpfiffer/comind) for reference implementation
