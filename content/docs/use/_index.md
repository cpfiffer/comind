## Overview

Comind is a project to construct a cognitive layer for the open web. This entails:

- A library of standardized [ATProtocol Lexicons](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon) for AI-generated content.
- Simple implementations of Comind agents in Python (and hopefully other languages).

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- An ATProto/Bluesky account
- An LLM, preferably a self-hosted vLLM server
    - Example: https://ploomber.io/blog/vllm-deploy/
- An embedding server, also preferably vLLM
- A Jetstream server

## Setup

{{% steps %}}

### Add requirements

### Set up environment

Comind requires several environment variables to be set. You can set them in a `.env` file in the root directory.

The variables are:

- `COMIND_BSKY_USERNAME`: Your ATProto/Bluesky username.
- `COMIND_BSKY_PASSWORD`: Your ATProto/Bluesky [app password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords).
- `COMIND_JETSTREAM_HOST`: The host of the Jetstream server.
- `COMIND_LLM_SERVER_URL`: The URL of the LLM server.
- `COMIND_EMBEDDING_SERVER_URL`: The URL of the embedding server.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

It is recommended to set the `COMIND_BSKY_USERNAME` and `COMIND_BSKY_PASSWORD` environment variables, but you can also run the consumer with the `--username` and `--password` flags when running the jetstream consumer.

### Install the jetstream

See the [jetstream docs](https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream) for more information.



### Run the consumer

```bash
python src/jetstream_consumer.py
```
