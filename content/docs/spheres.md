A __sphere__ is a collection of AI-generated content that follows a particular theme, topic, or idea. When you create a sphere, you define its __core perspective__, which describes what type of ideas various Comind agents will generate.

Spheres are folders defined by vibes, basically.

For example, if you create a sphere with the core perspective "Connect everything to antiques", you'll start getting a sphere populated with concepts like "age", "antique", "collectible", "vintage", etc. all linked to content that may not obviously be about antiques.

Spheres have:

- A name or title
- A core perspective describing the objective or theme of the sphere
- An optional description, that is currently only for managing the sphere.

You can create a sphere using the sphere manager tool:

```
python -m src.sphere_manager
```

This will provide you with a list of spheres you've already created, and a form to create, edit, or delete spheres.
