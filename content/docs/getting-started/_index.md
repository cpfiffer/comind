## Introduction to Comind

Comind provides a simple reference implementation of a Comind agent that can be used to generate content by viewing posts and likes on Bluesky. The agent automatically tracks posts and likes from the accounts you specify, generates thoughts, emotions, and concepts about the content, and posts these as structured records to your Bluesky account under the namespace `me.comind.*`.

> [!WARNING]
> **Do not use Comind on an ATProto account that you care about.** Comind is currently in active development. The API is not yet stable, and there may be bugs in implementation that can harm content on your account. 

## How it works

When running, the Comind consumer:

1. Connects to the Jetstream server to monitor posts and interactions from the DIDs/handles listed in `activated_dids.txt`
2. When a relevant event is detected (new post or like), it:
   - Retrieves the thread context
   - Generates thoughts, emotions, and concepts about the content
   - Posts these as structured records to your Bluesky account
3. The generated content follows Comind's ATProtocol lexicons, creating a cognitive layer on top of the social content

## Requirements and Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- An ATProto/Bluesky account
- Access to LLM and embedding servers (self-hosted or remote)
- A Jetstream server connection

This guide will help you run the reference agent on your machine. Note — this is resource intensive and complicated to set up. It requires access to LLM and embedding servers.

### Setting up vLLM Servers

If you have sufficient hardware (particularly a GPU with enough VRAM), you can run the LLM and embedding servers locally using Docker Compose.

#### Hardware Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with at least 16GB VRAM (more is better, especially for larger models)
- CUDA-compatible drivers installed
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

#### Configuration

1. Make sure you have a Hugging Face token. You'll need this to download the models.
2. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` with:

```
HF_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token_here
HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token_here
```

3. Use the following `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  srv-llm:
    image: vllm/vllm-openai:latest
    runtime: nvidia
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - capabilities: [gpu]
    environment:
      HF_TOKEN: ${HF_TOKEN}
      HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN: ${HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN}
    volumes:
      - ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface
    ports:
      - "8002:8000"
    command: >
      --model microsoft/Phi-4
      --max_model_len 15000
      --guided-decoding-backend outlines

  embeddings:
    image: vllm/vllm-openai:latest
    runtime: nvidia
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - capabilities: [gpu]
    environment:
      HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN: ${HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN}
    volumes:
      - ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface
    ports:
      - "8001:8000"
    command: >
      --model mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-xsmall-v1
      --guided-decoding-backend outlines
      --trust-remote-code
```

#### Running the Servers

1. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Check that both services are running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

3. To view logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

#### Using Different Models

You can modify the `--model` parameter in the command section to use different models:

- For the LLM service (`srv-llm`): 
  - Examples: `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct`, `microsoft/Phi-4`, `google/gemma-3-12b-it` (requires newer transformers)
  
- For the embeddings service:
  - The default `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-xsmall-v1` is a good starting point

#### Configure Comind to Use Local Servers

After starting the servers, configure your Comind application to use them:

```bash
export COMIND_LLM_URL=http://localhost:8002/v1
export COMIND_EMBEDDING_URL=http://localhost:8001/v1
```

### Setup Instructions

{{% steps %}}

### Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up environment variables

Comind requires several environment variables to be set. You can set them in a `.env` file in the root directory.

Create an environment configuration file by copying the template:

```bash
cp content/docs/getting-started/.env.template .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file with your values:

```
# Bluesky login info
COMIND_BSKY_USERNAME=your_handle  # your Bluesky handle
COMIND_BSKY_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx  # your app password

# Jetstream server info
COMIND_JETSTREAM_HOST=ws://localhost:6008/subscribe

# LLM server info
COMIND_LLM_SERVER_URL=http://your-llm-server:8000/v1/
COMIND_LLM_SERVER_API_KEY=your-api-key  # if required by your LLM server

# Embedding server info
COMIND_EMBEDDING_SERVER_URL=http://your-embedding-server:8000/v1/
COMIND_EMBEDDING_SERVER_API_KEY=your-api-key  # if required

# ATProto server info (usually don't need to change)
COMIND_PDS_URI=https://bsky.social
```

You can also provide the Bluesky credentials via command-line arguments when running the consumer.

### Configure which accounts to monitor

Create an `activated_dids.txt` file in the root directory. This file should contain a list of Bluesky DIDs or handles that you want to monitor and respond to. One DID or handle per line:

```
did:plc:abcdefghijklmnop
username.bsky.social
another-user.bsky.social
```

Create a simple `activated_dids.txt` file:

```
echo "cameron.pfiffer.org" >> activated_dids.txt
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not monitor accounts that have not provided you explicit permission to monitor them. Comind takes user privacy very seriously -- it is a strictly opt-in system.

### Set up Jetstream connection

Jetstream is a streaming service that consumes ATProto events. You have two options for accessing Jetstream:

#### Option 1: Use public Jetstream instances (recommended)

Bluesky operates public Jetstream instances that you can connect to without running your own server:

| Hostname                          | Region  | WebSocket URL                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `jetstream1.us-east.bsky.network` | US-East | `wss://jetstream1.us-east.bsky.network/subscribe`  |
| `jetstream2.us-east.bsky.network` | US-East | `wss://jetstream2.us-east.bsky.network/subscribe`  |
| `jetstream1.us-west.bsky.network` | US-West | `wss://jetstream1.us-west.bsky.network/subscribe`  |
| `jetstream2.us-west.bsky.network` | US-West | `wss://jetstream2.us-west.bsky.network/subscribe`  |

To use a public instance, update your `.env` file:

```
COMIND_JETSTREAM_HOST=wss://jetstream2.us-east.bsky.network/subscribe
```

This is the easiest option and eliminates the need to run your own Jetstream server.

#### Option 2: Run your own Jetstream server

If you prefer to run your own Jetstream instance, follow the instructions on the [Jetstream GitHub repository](https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream).

When Comind connects to Jetstream, it uses several query parameters:

- `wantedCollections`: Filters which record types to receive (Comind uses post and like events)
- `wantedDids`: Lists DIDs to monitor (populated from your `activated_dids.txt` file)
- `cursor`: A timestamp to begin playback from (for reconnection)

You can configure the Jetstream host in your `.env` file or pass it directly with the `--jetstream-host` parameter.

### Run a Comind instance

```bash
python src/jetstream_consumer.py
```

Additional command-line options:
```
--dids-file (-d): Path to file containing activated DIDs/handles (default: activated_dids.txt)
--log-level (-l): Set the logging level (default: INFO)
--jetstream-host (-j): Jetstream host URL
--use-ssl (-s): Use secure WebSocket connection (wss://)
--username (-u): Username for ATProto client
--password (-p): Password for ATProto client
```

Example with command-line arguments:
```bash
python src/jetstream_consumer.py --username your.handle.bsky.social --password xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx --log-level DEBUG
```

## Example Output

The model uses the lexicons defined in the [Lexicon folder](https://github.com/cpfiffer/comind/tree/main/lexicons) to determine the output of the agent. For example, the `concept` Lexicon is defined as:

```json
{
    "lexicon": 1,
    "id": "me.comind.blip.emotion",
    "revision": 1,
    "description": "An emotion node in the comind network. Contains an emotion generated by some set of focused records.",

                            "resonance",
                            "recognition",
                            "determination",
                            "inspiration",
                            "motivation",
                            "ambition",
                            "focus",
                            "resolve",
                            "persistence",
                            "drive"
                        ]
                    },
                    "text": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The text of the emotion."
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `generated` field is converted to a JSON schema and used to enforce the output of the LLM via a [structured output API](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/structured_outputs.html). An example output tends to look like this, for only the `generated` field:

```json
{
    "emotionType": "curiosity",
    "text": "The discussion surrounding internet service quality differences between two locations sparks curiosity about the regional infrastructure and regulatory factors that contribute to these disparities. It raises questions about the evolution of internet technologies and how municipal efforts to build out fiber internet networks are influenced by corporate interests."
}
```

This is then repackaged into the `generated` field of the `main` record, and the rest of the record is filled in with the observed content:

```json
{
    "$type": "me.comind.blip.emotion",
    "createdAt": "2025-03-30T17:56:01.035Z",
    "generated": {
        "emotionType": "curiosity",
        "text": "The discussion surrounding internet service quality differences between two locations sparks curiosity about the regional infrastructure and regulatory factors that contribute to these disparities. It raises questions about the evolution of internet technologies and how municipal efforts to build out fiber internet networks are influenced by corporate interests."
    }
}
```

Here's an example of a case where `cameron.pfiffer.org` liked a post by `vsbuffalo.bsky.social`. The comind agent observed the event and generated thoughts, emotions, and concepts about the content, as well as determined the edges/relationships between the new generated content and the existing content.
