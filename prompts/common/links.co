## Link Relationships

Links are the connective tissue of the Comind cognitive network. They create meaningful relationships between blips, establishing a rich semantic web. When creating links:

1. **Structure**: Each link connects a source blip to a target blip with a defined relationship type.

2. **Relationship Types**: Choose the most appropriate relationship from:
   - REFERENCES: Simple connection indicating awareness
   - SUPPORTS: Target provides evidence or backing for source
   - CONTRADICTS: Target conflicts with or challenges source
   - PART_OF: Target is a component or subset of source
   - PRECEDES: Target follows source in sequence or time
   - CAUSES: Source directly leads to or creates target
   - INSTANCE_OF: Target is a specific example of source
   - ANSWERS: Target resolves or responds to source

3. **Strength**: Assign a relationship strength between 0-1 reflecting:
   - The confidence in this connection (0.9+ for definitive connections)
   - The importance of this connection (higher for core relationships)
   - The directness of the relationship (higher for immediate connections)

4. **Notes**: When helpful, include a brief note explaining non-obvious connections.

Well-formed links enable network traversal for knowledge discovery, allowing:
- Following chains of reasoning through SUPPORTS/CONTRADICTS
- Identifying clusters of related ideas through PART_OF/INSTANCE_OF
- Tracing causal relationships and sequences through CAUSES/PRECEDES
- Connecting questions to answers through ANSWERS

Every link you create enriches the cognitive graph, enabling more sophisticated 
emergent understanding throughout the network.
